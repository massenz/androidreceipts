     This file contains all configuration strings and values that are necessary for
     AR to be correctly configured at startup (especially at first install, before the
     user has had any opportunity to set its preferences.

  <!-- The tag to be used for the DDMS Log -->
  <item name="TAG" type="string">alertavert.receipts</item>

<!-- Default connections parameters, to be used if no user preferences are set
     These could also be used as the _sole_ connections parameters, and the
     ability to change these values disabled (eg, in an Enterprise deployment, where
     only the IT personnell would be able to alter these values prior to deployment).

     The 'action_xxx' items represent servlet mappings in the meaning of web.xml
     configuration parameters (servlet-mapping's url-pattern values); they ought to
     be appended to the server's ip (or name), port and context to obtain the
     complete URL to use to complete any given action.

     action_upload
     to upload receipts metadata and images; expects a POST and a payload
     composed of one (and only one) ReceiptsPayload protobuf;

     action_ping
     used to test connection, a simple HEAD method, to verify the
     connection's parameters and that the server is responding;

     action_auth
     initiated to authenticate the user and initialize a valid Token

     action_account_sync
     to retrieve user's account details and preferences
     if a GET is used, a retrieval operation is expected, and a fully
     populated UserSettings protobuf returned;
     if a POST, a UserSettings proto should be sent to the server that will be
     used to update whichever fields are present, and a fully populated protobuf
     will be returned.
